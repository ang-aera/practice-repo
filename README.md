# PRACTICE

Description of what this is about

## STEP ONE

Learning how to use the Linux terminal to navigate my PC
Have just finished setting up SSH key for GIT to this WSL Ubuntu
* It took quite a while to get it but here we are
* I do not know why I am reluctant to practice on the sandbox
* Maybe it is because I am able to play around with stuff without fear of tampering with my assigments

### TRYING OUT THE GIT PULL COMMAND
This should be fun
